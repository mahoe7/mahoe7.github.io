For our final project in ICS464, my team had decided on creating a Tinder-like app except for gamers. Instead of searching for romance, our app was designed for players to look for other skilled players in their area so that they could form a competitive team. Due to time constraints, we were only ever able to create an extremely rough program that didn't run while our final vision was left as a paper prototype.

For this project, I came up with the various functions that it would require, researched how Tinder worked and how it could be used for this app, and found users to test it. The most important thing I learned from this project was how to work with a team willing to work with you and how to only consider the most important/relevant cases. An error that I made in the earlier days of my software engineering history was trying to make programs that accounted for absolutely every single case, which ended up hampering the overall quality of my product.
