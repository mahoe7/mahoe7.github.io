summary: A responsive web app for tracking money
---

Mon-E is a web app that I made as my final project for ICS415. It was built using Meteor, a Javascript framework that allowed for real-time database updates from client-side interactions.

Mon-E was a simple app that allowed users to create accounts and categories for where their money was going. While the app itself did not do much, I did make it mobile-friendly.

Unfortunately, I did not save this project to an online or external storage and the computer that had it met an unfortunate end.
