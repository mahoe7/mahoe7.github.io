Manoa Kine Grindz is a web app that me and my team built as a final project for ICS314. We wanted to create an app where people could easily find where to go if they wanted to get food of a certain cuisine on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus. Unfortunately, due to getting caught in development hell, we could not churn out a fully functional or even decent website.

My contributions to the project was creating the overall layout, some of the functionality, and the direction to take the website in. From this experience, even though I learned it too late, I now know when to take a project by the reins and to do the major things myself. However, a giant obstacle I encountered was the lack of direction for the project. As we worked on it, we realized that the initial functions that we wanted were all obsolete or lacking. Most of the food vendors on campus did not change menu or locations, and the only ones that did change their menu were The Market, a small convenience store near the dorms, and the dorm cafeterias, who had their own online resource. As such, we sought to implement a changing menu based on the user's interest of what they do and do not like to eat, but even then it became a moot point as the only time it would prove useful is if the dorm cafeterias or The Market would serve something they liked. Overall, with the limited time we had, we could not settle on a solid direction for the website.
